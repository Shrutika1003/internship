# Sentiment analysis of women's clothes reviews 

## General info

The project concerns sentiment analysis of clothes reviews to determine whether the product is recommended or not. Moreover it includes data analysis, data preparation, text mining and build model by using virtue different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The project also includes EDA analysis and sentiment analysis by using Vader and TextBlob methods.

The dataset comes from Woman Clothing Review that can be find at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews). 

## Motivation
The goal of the project is sentiment analysis of clothes reviews by using the various methods and determine possible recommendation.
